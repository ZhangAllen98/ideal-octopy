Documentation for GMATOrbitMapper

This package maps GMAT Orbit data in Google Earth as
another way to visualize the ground track of the orbit.

The script map.py takes command line arguments to make the maps. The
python package kml has the python modules this is based off of.

The script test.sh has an example call to the map.py script. Running this
will make the 'test.kmz' sample file.
